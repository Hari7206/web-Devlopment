        The syntax used to create internal hyperlinks varies between wiki implementations. Beginning with the
        WikiWikiWeb in 1995, most wikis used camel case to name pages,[16] which is when words in a phrase are
        capitalized and the spaces between them removed. In this system, the phrase "camel case" would be rendered as
        "CamelCase". In early wiki engines, when a page was displayed, any instance of a camel case phrase would be
        transformed into a link to another page named with the same phrase.

        While this system made it easy to link to pages, it had the downside of requiring pages to be named in a form
        deviating from standard spelling, and titles of a single word required abnormally capitalizing one of the
        letters (e.g. "WiKi" instead of "Wiki"). Some wiki implementations attempt to improve the display of camel case
        page titles and links by reinserting spaces and possibly also reverting to lower case, but this simplistic
        method is not able to correctly present titles of mixed capitalization. For example, "Kingdom of France" as a
        page title would be written as "KingdomOfFrance", and displayed as "Kingdom Of France".

        To avoid this problem, the syntax of wiki markup gained free links, wherein a term in natural language could be
        wrapped in special characters to turn it into a link without modifying it. The concept was given the name in its
        first implementation, in UseModWiki in February 2001.[17] In that implementation, link terms were wrapped in a
        double set of square brackets, for example [[Kingdom of France]]. This syntax was adopted by a number of later
        wiki engines.

        It is typically possible for users of a wiki to create links to pages that do not yet exist, as a way to invite
        the creation of those pages. Such links are usually differentiated visually in some fashion, such as being
        colored red instead of the default blue, which was the case in the original WikiWikiWeb, or by appearing as a
        question mark next to the linked words.

        "A wiki invites all users—not just experts—to edit any page or to create new pages within the wiki website,
        using only a standard 'plain-vanilla' Web browser without any extra add-ons."
        "Wiki promotes meaningful topic associations between different pages by making page link creation intuitively
        easy and showing whether an intended target page exists or not."
        "A wiki is not a carefully crafted site created by experts and professional writers and designed for casual
        visitors. Instead, it seeks to involve the typical visitor/user in an ongoing process of creation and
        collaboration that constantly changes the website landscape."

            The realization of the Hawaiian /w/ phoneme varies between [w] and [v], and the realization of the /k/ phoneme varies between [k] and [t], among other realizations. Thus, the pronunciation of the Hawaiian word wiki varies between ['wiki], ['witi], ['viki], and ['viti]. See Hawaiian phonology for more details.

        /* so the basic syntax is
        $('selector').action()  
        this is how we write the 2 funtion in the js query in which first pranthisis we take the selector which element we want to select and in the next after the dot we take the action what work we want to done in our js query */
